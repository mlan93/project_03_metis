# Project 03 - Poverty Classification
**By Max Lan**

**Overview:**

The files within include 2 Jupyter notebooks, one .py file, and multiple pickle files. Reviewers should begin by reading "Project_3_Data_Cleaning_Weights.ipynb", which details the majority of the work performed, including data cleaning, modeling, and conclusions reached.


"Project_3_Data_Cleaning_Weights.ipynb" is supported by "AWS_Models.py", a python file used on AWS to perform a grid search on xgboost, as well as "State_Model_Regression.ipynb", which includes models performed for each of the states within the dataframe. The various pickle files include models generated from these notebooks and were retained for efficiency.

**Data Visualization**

Note the data visualization component of the project is not yet complete. While pickle files have been generated for xgboost models for each of the states, implementation of these within Tableau (and eventually flask) is still in progress.
